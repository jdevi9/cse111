Please take a few minutes to reflect on your experience in CSE 111 and
think about the challenges, successes, and all that you've learned
along the way.


Now, please respond thoroughly (1 - 2 paragraphs for each question) to
the following questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.

I think when it really stood out to me the power of functions was during week 5 and 6 with the 
sentences program. Having each part of the sentence broken out to its own function really helped 
me see how beneficial it is to take the time to break things out and then have all those pieces come 
together. What's nice, is if I have a project that requires something similar, I don't have to hunt for 
it. I can open up that program and extract that a specific function.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?

Test functions are good to make sure things are working as they should. Especially, as you getting into longer
and more complex code, it's nice to write a simple function that will make sure that you're getting the right 
answer at the end. So instead of having to run the program a million times with each change, you can easily 
run a test function to assert that everything is working to how are expecting it to.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

When I need to troubleshoot I first look at the error code and research it if needed. 
Then once I know the potential problem, I run the code in debugging mode with several 
breakpoints along the way. I go line by line to see where I can spot the mistake if it's 
obvious. I'm not sure what I can improve on, but I will try and build test-functions as I 
go. For instance, build a function that put together a test-function to go with it. 
I think that would make it a faster and easier process.

Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program?
Coder & Decoder 

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve?
With this you can choose between 3 different types of ciphers. A Caeser cihper, a ROT13 cipher and a Vingere cipher. 
You can then choose to code or decode a messge for each kind. This will be helpful for me in generating a password to use on 
different accounts. 

3. What will you learn from developing this program?
I will get more practice using "for" loops, iterating through arrays, converting letters to numbers to perform math on text and 
practicing a brute-force cryptanalysis algorithm.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.)
I will be using pytest and pyperclip. However, I am thinking of making a nice GUI to go with the program, if I can learn it. 

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Each cipher coding will be its own function. Also the decoding will be its own funciton. There will be a funciton for the input of 
the messages and output. 

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions?
I am going to implement a test for each function. Mostly it will be a test to assert a certain combination works given the parameters.
